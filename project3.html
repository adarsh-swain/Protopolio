    <h1>Analog Clock</h1>
    <h3>Introduction: </h3>
    <p>In this article, we are going to describe how to make an analogue clock using the Graphics class in Java. To make
        an analogue clock we need to use the Thread and Graphics Classes of Java.<br> The threading concept is used to
        move
        the second, minute and hours hands of the clock and the Graphics class is used to create a line and oval and
        colour of the hands.<br>

        These are the steps for creating an analogue clock.</p>
    <h3>Step 2:</h3>
    <p> Define a variable and make the object of the SimpleDate format class. <br>
        Here the xcenter and ycenter
        variables are used to define the centre coordinate of the clock and the lastxs and lastys variables used to
        define the<br>
         End coordinate of the second's hand and the other variables are lastxm, lastym, lastxh, lastyh are
        also used for defining the end coordinate of the minutes and hours hands.</p>
    <h3>Step 3:</h3>
    <p>We are creating a structured method for the design of the analog clock.<br> In this method we set the digit
        (3,6,9,12) coordinates and create an oval and set the color of digit and oval.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: </h3>
    <p>Calculate the seconds, minutes and hours coordinates from the current time by getting the system time.
        And convert the value into an integer form.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: </h3>
    <p>For moving needle logics. Actually in the following line we define some general condition that is found
        in all types of clocks such as <br>
        when the seconds hand reaches 12 then the minutes hand moves 1 step and then
        after moving 5 steps of the minutes hand then 1-stepmoves a hours needle.</p>
    <h3>Step 6: </h3>
    <p> For moving needle minute and hours. this code for set the color of needle and moving forward rest of if
        conditions.</p>
    <h3>Step 7:</h3>
    <p>Define the method of Runable Interface. In the following, all the methods of the Runable interface must
        be overriden with the definitons of their own <br>
        functionality within the stop method we pass 100 microseconds and
        this method throws an interrupt exception so these are put into a try block.</p>
        <h3>Step 8: </h3>
    <p>Creating a frame within main methods. In the following code we define three things creating the object of
        the Color and Frame Clock classes and set the background color and add a content pane on the frame.</p>

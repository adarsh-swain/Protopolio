    <h1>Online University Management</h1><br>

    <h3>Project Objective: </h3>
    <p>This Online University Management system can be used to manage and keep track of information such as lecture
        times, lecture attendance and student marks.<br>
        This system will serve as a useful interface between lecturers and
        the students.<br>
        This system will be hosted on the college intranet so as to prevent outside hacks into the system.<br>

        After a student has signed up for the lectures for a semester the system will automatically create a student
        schedule.<br>
        The lecturer can also schedule extra lectures using this system and the system will automatically
        parse the schedules of all the students attending the lecture to find and resolve any scheduling conflicts.<br>

        Lecturers will be able to access the system in the classroom and take attendance directly using the
        software.<br>
        This attendance will automatically be logged in and both the students and lecturer will be able to access this
        information at any time. Students will be informed if they are close to being short of the required
        attendance.<br>
        Lecturers will also be able to post marks for the various tests and exams using this system.<br>
        Students need not
        have to crowd at the lecturer’s office for the same. Students can also raise doubts about the marks awarded and
        the attendance noted using this system.<br>
        The system will maintain a record of doubts and the lecturer can
        personally resolve these doubts.<br>
        At the end of the semester students have to submit documents pertaining to their
        attendance or marks to the academic department for verification, this process can be automated with the presence
        of this system. The system will automatically collate the attendance and mark details for each student
        individually and submit verified reports of the same.</p><br>
    <h3>Existing system: </h3>
    <p>The existing Online University Management system consists of different attendance and mark files maintained by
        the lecturer.<br>
        These file have to be verified and collated by an official before it can be entered into the
        official record.<br>
        Students often have to pester their lecturers or the academic department to view their
        attendance details and marks before publication and only then are they able to raise any doubts about the same.
        There is a whole lot of paper that is wasted in this whole process as well.</p>
    <h3>Proposed system: </h3>
    <p>The proposed Online University Management system will be entirely maintained on the college intranet, this will
        ensure that students will be able to easily access this information at any time.<br>
        Constant access to this
        information will enforce accountability both on the lecturer’s part to update the information and on the
        student’s part to ensure that the data is accurate. <br>
        End of semester formalities will become easier with access
        to an automatically collated and verified report.<br>
        Lecturers will also be able to easily schedule extra classes
        for students. Students can be ensured that the system will inform them about any extra class.</p>
    <h3>Modules</h3>
    <h4>Admin:</h4>
    <p>The admin module will be able to create login IDs for the student and the lecturer. The admin module will have to
        enter the courses that a student has been enrolled for at the start of the year. The admin module can also
        download the collated reports for the student at the end of the semester.<br>

        Lecturer:The lecturer module will inform the lecturer about the lectures they are supposed to take. The lecturer
        can enter the attendance and the marks of each student on this system. The lecturer can also view any doubts
        raised by students about the attendance and marks using this system.<br>

        Student: The student module will enable students to view their attendance and mark information. Students will
        have to verify the courses they are enrolled in at the start of the year. They can also use the system to raise
        any doubts with their lecturer regarding their attendance and marks.</p>
